Here are a few sample questions to begin with:

1. Basic Loops and Conditionals (JavaScript or Python):
   - Write a program to print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
   - Write a program that takes an integer as input and checks whether the number is a prime number or not
   - Write a program that takes an integer as input and prints whether it is odd or even.
   - Write a program to find the largest number in a list/array.

2. Working with Lists/Arrays (Python or JavaScript):
   - Write a program to reverse a list/array.
   - Write a program to count the frequency of each element in a list/array.
   - Write a program to remove duplicates from a list/array.

3. Simple String Manipulation (JavaScript or Python):
   - Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome.
   - Write a program to count the number of vowels in a string.
   - Write a program to convert a string to uppercase without using any built-in functions.

4. Basic Recursion (Python or JavaScript):
   - Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a number.
   - Write a recursive function to find the nth Fibonacci number.
   - Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of all elements in a list/array.
